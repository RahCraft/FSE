# ~~~~~ INFO ON NUMPY ARRAYS

# Numpy arrays are similar to 2D Python lists with the following differences:
# - Are fully dimensional, unlike Python lists, which uses lists inside lists to become dimensional
# - Dimensions in arrays are called 'axes' (singular 'axis')
# - Are much faster than python lists
# - Use 'tuples' of information to represent 'coordinates', while lists use 'indices' to represent 'locations'

# Since numpy arrays are so much faster than lists, we use them to store the world
